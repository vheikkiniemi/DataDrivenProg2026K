# 📘 Course Introduction: Data-Driven Programming (Vibe Coding)

## What is this course about?

This course focuses on **building simple data-driven applications** that support business thinking and decision-making.
You will learn how data can be:

* structured,
* stored,
* and used in applications

to produce **useful insights**, not just code.

The goal is **not** to turn you into a professional programmer.
The goal is to help you **understand and use data through applications**.

## 🌊 What is Vibe Coding?

This course is built around **Vibe Coding**, which means:

> You learn by *experimenting, exploring, and building* — not by memorizing syntax.

Vibe Coding emphasizes:

* ideas before code
* visible results early
* learning through iteration
* collaboration instead of individual struggle

You will:

* start from an **idea**
* work with **realistic data**
* build a **working application prototype**
* improve it step by step

Mistakes are expected. Trying things out is encouraged.

## 🔄 How is this course different from traditional courses?

| Traditional course | This course                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Starts with theory | Starts with an idea        |
| Focus on syntax    | Focus on meaning and value |
| Individual work    | Group-based learning       |
| Fixed instructions | Iterative exploration      |
| One final exam     | Continuous development     |

There is **no heavy theory**, **no long lectures**, and **no final written exam**. Learning happens by **doing and reflecting**.

---

## 👥 Group-Based Learning

All project work is done in **small groups (2–4 students)**.

Working in groups allows you to:

* discuss ideas instead of working alone
* divide tasks based on strengths
* learn from others
* reduce technical pressure

You are **not expected to know programming beforehand**.

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technology

You will work with:

* **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** (only the basics needed)
* **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** for building applications
* **[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/)** for simple databases

All tools are chosen because they:

* are beginner-friendly
* give quick, visible results
* support experimentation

---

## 💻 Development Tools: Visual Studio Code & GitHub

In this course, you will use **[Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** as part of your project work.

These tools are not chosen randomly — they are **industry-standard tools** used widely in modern software and data-related work.

---

### 🧩 Why Visual Studio Code?

**Visual Studio Code** is a powerful but beginner-friendly development environment.

You will use it because:

* it helps you organize files and data clearly
* it supports Python development very well
* it provides helpful feedback while you work
* it makes experimenting and learning easier

You do **not** need prior experience with VS Code. You will learn only what is necessary to work effectively on your project.

---

### 🌍 Why GitHub?

**GitHub** is a platform for storing, managing, and sharing projects.

You will use GitHub because it:

* makes your project **visible and shareable**
* allows you to track progress and changes
* supports collaboration in group work
* is widely used in professional environments

Most importantly:

> Your project does not disappear after the course.

With GitHub, your project can:

* be shown to employers
* be linked in your CV or LinkedIn profile
* demonstrate practical skills, not just course completion

This means the work you do in this course can directly support your **professional visibility and employability**.

---

### 🚀 From Course Project to Portfolio Project

Thanks to Git and GitHub:

* your application can be version-controlled
* your development process becomes visible
* your learning turns into concrete evidence

Even a **simple project** is valuable when it:

* solves a real problem
* uses data meaningfully
* is clearly documented

This course helps you create something you can be **proud to show**.

---

### 🧠 Important note

You are **not expected to become an expert** in these tools.

You are expected to:

* use them at a basic level
* understand their purpose
* gain confidence working with professional tools

The focus remains on **ideas, data, and learning by doing** — the tools simply support that process.

---

## 💬 Learning Through Discussion

All assignments are completed as **discussion-based tasks**.

This means:

* you post your work to a discussion area
* you comment on other groups’ work
* you learn from different ideas and approaches

Discussions are part of the learning process — not just submissions.

---

## 🎯 What will you be able to do after this course?

After completing the course, you will be able to:

* understand different ways to manage data
* design and implement a simple database
* use a database in an application
* explain how a data-driven application supports business decisions
* confidently explore and experiment with technical solutions

---

## 🧠 Important mindset for this course

You do **not** need to:

* be perfect
* understand everything immediately
* write “clean” or advanced code

You **do** need to:

* be curious
* participate
* try things out
* reflect on what you learn

This course is about **progress, not perfection**.
